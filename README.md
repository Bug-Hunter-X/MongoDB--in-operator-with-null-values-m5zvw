# MongoDB $in operator with null values

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries with arrays containing `null` values.

The `bug.js` file contains a query that incorrectly uses `$in` with `null`. The `bugSolution.js` file shows the corrected query.

## Bug
The `$in` operator is designed to check if a field's value is present within a given array. However, when an array contains `null`, the behavior might be unexpected.  `null` values aren't directly comparable using `$in`. 

## Solution
The solution involves a more sophisticated query approach, often involving the use of `$or` or handling `null` values separately depending on the desired outcome.
